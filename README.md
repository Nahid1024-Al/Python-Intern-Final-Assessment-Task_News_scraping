News Scraper and Sentiment Analyzer

This project is a Python-based web scraping tool that extracts news data from multiple URLs, gathers various metadata attributes, and integrates sentiment analysis using Huggingface's transformer models. The scraped data is then saved into a structured JSON file for further analysis.
